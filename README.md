# Custom Printf Project
- Overview:
The ft_printf project is a simplified replica of the original printf function in C. The primary focus is to create a compact yet robust utility that handles a limited set of format specifiers: %c, %s, %d, %i, %u, %p, %x, %X, and %%. This project serves as an introduction to basic parsing, utilizes the va_arg macro for variable arguments, and emphasizes error handling to enhance understanding and mastery of C programming concepts.

## Key Features:
- Limited Format Specifiers:

Supports %c, %s, %d, %i, %u, %p, %x, %X, and %%.
- Basic Parsing:

Implements rudimentary parsing logic for supported format specifiers.
- Variable Arguments (va_arg):

Utilizes the va_arg macro for handling variable arguments.
- Error Handling:

Incorporates comprehensive error checking to enhance reliability.
- Write Function Protection:

Guards against errors in the write function to ensure smooth execution.
